## Frozen-window CPU limitation (review disclosure)

CPU here is only measured-window getrusage, NOT complete-lifecycle or steady-state per-transaction CPU. The Apple Go binding releases native transactions/futures through Go GC finalizers (7.3.77 bindings/go/src/fdb/database.go:102-106,futures.go:93); transaction destruction then queues native network-thread work (bindings/c/fdb_c.cpp:921-926;fdbclient/ThreadSafeTransaction.cpp:402-406). Warmup cleanup can enter the window; late measured-transaction cleanup can fall after it. No finalizer/network drain brackets this frozen V6 window. The size/direction of that unequal deferred-cleanup effect is unmeasured. These CPU ratios are provisional window observations, not published native full-cost/capacity claims; a separate lifecycle-accounting campaign is required. GC counts are Go-runtime cycles, not a proof that all C++ cleanup completed.
