# TODOs

FoundationDB Record Layer — Go Port. Java version: **4.11.1.0**. FDB wire protocol: **7.3.75**.

Current state: 46 test targets, 639+ SQL tests passing, 270 yamsql scenarios, 508 cross-engine specs, 105 fuzz targets, ~65 Cascades rules, 41 plan types (36 executor-wired), 48 value types, 9 predicate types. Unified Cascades task stack (REWRITING + PLANNING). Winner-based plan selection with per-ordering properties.

## Known gaps

### vs Java (correctness/feature parity)

- [x] **Correlated filter without index.** Fixed in 56874f23 — ImplementFilterRule sets innerAlias on RecordQueryPredicatesFilterPlan. All correlated paths (scalar subquery, EXISTS, JOIN) work without indexes. 14+ integration tests verify.
- [ ] **No RIGHT/FULL OUTER JOIN.** Only LEFT OUTER is implemented.
- [x] **Correlated scalar subquery shapes widened.** Non-aggregate (ORDER BY + LIMIT), multi-table inner FROM (JOINs), multi-column validation, deep-walk replaceScalarSubqueryRef. GROUP BY/HAVING rejected with clear errors (PredicatePushDownRule AliasMap conflict). CorrelatedExistsError propagation fixed.
- [ ] **No window functions.** No `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `LAG/LEAD`.
- [ ] **GROUP BY/HAVING in correlated scalar subqueries.** Requires PredicatePushDownRule to treat GroupByExpression as a barrier (AliasMap.Compose conflict on correlation alias). Per Graefe: runtime cardinality assertions incompatible with continuation-based pagination — use Java's FirstOrDefault pattern.
- [ ] **PlanVisitor resolver lacks SubqueryPlanner.** Scalar subquery error messages don't propagate through step (2) projection resolution because the resolver has no SubqueryPlanner. workaround: errors propagate through upgradeProjectionValues (step 12) instead.

### Beyond Java (Go-only improvements)

- [ ] **Full Graefe Memo with cross-group merging.** Neither Java nor Go implements the Cascades paper's cross-Reference equivalence class merging. Per-Reference dedup suffices for current workloads (CRUD, simple joins, aggregates). Full Memo would unlock optimal multi-way join ordering (5+ tables) and redundant subexpression elimination. Significant effort — the `B3` follow-on in codebase comments.
- [x] **Correlated scalar subqueries.** Go-only extension — Java rejects at grammar level. Implemented via FlatMap with JoinTypeLeftOuter.

## Production readiness (Graefe review, 2026-05-28)

The Cascades architecture is solid — task stack, two-phase REWRITING+PLANNING, 16-criteria cost model, match-candidate infra all well-ported. The production risks are all at the **boundaries**: planner↔executor, executor↔runtime, system↔operator. Priority tiers below.

### P0 — fix before deploying anywhere (correctness/availability)

- [x] **P0.1 NLJ memory bomb.** Fixed in PR #203 — `CollectAllBounded` with configurable materialization limit (default 100K rows) on all 6 `CollectAll` sites. `MaterializationLimitExceededError` typed error. All cursor leaks on error path fixed. 11 regression tests. RFC-028.
- [x] **P0.2 Plan cache serves wrong plans.** Fixed in RFC-029 — cache keys on normalized SQL string directly (was uint64 FNV-64a hash with no text comparison on hit → collision = wrong plan). Scalar subquery staleness was a non-issue: `scalarSubqueryBinding` stores plans not results, re-evaluated per page fetch. `QueryHash` retained for tests only.
- [x] **P0.3 No context cancellation in executor.** Fixed in RFC-030 — `ctx.Err()` checks at the top of every cursor OnNext loop and drain function (44 sites across 19 files). `autoContinuingCursor` was the worst offender (created new FDB transactions on cancelled contexts). All cursor combinators, executor cursors, utility drains, DML drains, legacy query path drains, and iterator adapters now respect Go context cancellation. 24 unit tests verify prompt cancellation.

### P1 — fix before relying on the optimizer for real workloads (plan quality)

- [x] **P1.1 Wire statistics from FDB.** Fixed in RFC-031 — `fetchTableStatistics` was already wired (nightshift-100) but had two bugs: used read-write transactions for read-only stats (wasted commit), and fabricated equal-distribution counts for intermingled schemas. Fixed: `FDBDatabase.RunRead()` for no-commit snapshot reads, dropped intermingled fallback (returns nil → safe DefaultStatistics). E2E FDB integration test proves full pipeline: count maintenance → stats read → cost model → plan selection → execution.
- [x] **P1.2 Complete QOV-based FieldValue migration.** Fixed in RFC-032 — all 10 `stripAlias*` calls deleted (8 NLJ rule, 2 PushFilterBelowJoinRule). Predicates now retain `FieldValue(QOV(correlationId), "column")`; filters use `PredicatesFilterPlanWithAlias` so the executor binds each row under its correlation alias and resolves via `evaluateCorrelated` — zero string manipulation. `executePredicatesFilter` binds the inner alias whenever present (was gated on params only). Root cause exposed: `PartitionBinarySelectRule` (Java inner-join rule) fired on LEFT OUTER joins, pushing nullable-side predicates pre-join; guarded with `JoinInner`. `mergeRows` string qualification untouched (operates on executor row maps, not planner Values — separate concern). All 46 targets pass; determinism verified.

### P2 — fix before scaling operations

- [x] **P2.1 Plan cache LRU is O(n) per hit.** Fixed in RFC-033 — replaced the slice-based LRU order tracking (linear scan + slice splice in `promote()` on every hit, under the lock) with a `container/list` doubly-linked list + `map[string]*list.Element`. Promote-on-hit/update and eviction are now O(1), matching Java's Caffeine-backed cache. `RWMutex` downgraded to `Mutex` (the read path always mutated the list, so the read lock was a lie). `BenchmarkPlanCache_HitLargeCache` confirms position-independent O(1) hits at maxSize=1024; all existing LRU-semantics tests pass unchanged + new interleaved-eviction test.
- [ ] **P2.2 Operational debuggability.** No query logging, no slow-query log, no plan-in-error-message, no planning history. `PlannerEventHandler` exists but nil by default. First production question ("what plan did it pick?") requires re-running with EXPLAIN under the same data/params.
  - **Fix:** optional planning-metrics hook (nil = silent) logging SQL (truncated), plan hash, planning duration, cache hit/miss, estimated cost. Sample ~1% in production to structured output.

## Phase 8: Planner architecture cleanup (Graefe review findings)

### 8.1 Evaluate `pushDataAccessTasks` as CascadesRule — RESOLVED (keep procedural)

Graefe flagged this as procedural code that should be a rule. After investigation: **the procedural approach is architecturally correct.** `pushDataAccessTasks` operates on Reference-level PartialMatch state, not expression types — CascadesRules require expression-type pattern matching. Java uses explicit `TransformMatchPartition` task types for the same reason: this is task-level logic, not rule-level. Go's direct method call in `ExploreExprTask.Run()` is simpler and equivalent. No change needed.

### 8.2 Verify `promoteByDataAccessCost` heuristic absorbed — VERIFIED

`promoteByDataAccessCost` was deleted in eb94291a (dead code cleanup). Its heuristic (prefer lower-cardinality data access) IS absorbed into `PlanningCostModelLess` at `planning_cost_model.go:191–208` — Criterion #2: `maxDataAccessCardinality`, lower wins. This fires via `stampOrderingWinners(ref, costModel)` after every data access insertion. The cost model uses the same `findExpressionsByType` + `maxDataAccessCardinality` comparison. No heuristic was dropped.

### 8.3 Document `maxRoundsPerRef = 10` cap — DONE

Added comment at `unified_tasks.go:59` explaining: prevents divergence from rule cycles (A→B→A) that produce distinct-but-equivalent members. Java relies on memo dedup for fixpoint; Go's per-Reference dedup is weaker, so pathological rule interactions can produce new members indefinitely. 10 rounds >> typical 2–3 needed, safely under MaxTasks budget.

---

## Phase 7: Cascades alignment — close remaining Java divergences

### 7.1 Unify alias namespaces — DONE

Quantifier aliases now match table aliases at creation. Three band-aids removed: `rightAliasSet`, `planContainsJoin`, `collectPlanAliases` (−114 lines). Root-cause fix in `mergeRows`: bare inner keys overwrote qualified keys from nested joins (missing `!exists` guard). 46/46 tests, 15/15 determinism.

### 7.2 Port matching infrastructure for index intersections — DONE

`IndexIntersectionRule` deleted (Go-only REWRITING-phase rule). Replaced with match-based PLANNING-phase intersection via `WithPrimaryKeyIntersector` in `intersector_primary_key.go`. Wired into `pushDataAccessTasks` with guards: candidate cap (4), match cap (8), restricted-scan filter, idempotency via `hasIntersectionFinal`. Two regressions found and fixed: IS NULL correctness (zero-coverage matches created incorrect intersections, fixed by filtering to restricted scans only) and MaxTasks (intersection logic ran N times per Reference, fixed by idempotency guard). 46/46 tests, 10/10 determinism.

### 7.3 Convert remaining predicateReferencesAlias sites — DONE

All 8 `predicateReferencesAlias` calls in the NLJ rule converted to `GetCorrelatedToOfPredicate` correlation-set checks. Function deleted. Root-cause fix: `qualifyBareFieldValue` in EXISTS builder now produces QOV-based FieldValues instead of flat strings. `walkPredicateFieldValues`/`fieldValueAliasAndCol` survive in push-filter/push-projection rules (handle both QOV and flat FieldValues for unit test compatibility).

### 7.4 FlatMap wrapper correlation propagation — NOT NEEDED (Graefe confirmed)

Graefe confirmed: `GetCorrelatedToWithoutChildren()` returning empty is correct for BOTH joins AND correlated subqueries. Correlations flow through quantifier children in both cases. `JoinMergeResultValue.Children()` does NOT need QOV nodes.

For correlated scalar subqueries (Go-only extension, Java rejects at grammar level), the correct Cascades architecture is:
1. `ForEachNullOnEmpty` quantifier (already exists: `ForEachNullOnEmptyQuantifier`)
2. `RecordQueryFirstOrDefaultPlan` with NULL default (already exists)
3. Correlated `BuildScalar` fallback (needs: full inner plan with outer scope, correlation predicate extraction)
4. NLJ rule: detect NullOnEmpty → wrap inner with FirstOrDefault + FlatMap

NLJ wrapper correlation propagation (walks predicates) is already correct and active.
