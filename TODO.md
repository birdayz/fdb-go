## Known gaps

### vs Java (correctness/feature parity)

- [x] **Correlated filter without index.** Fixed in 56874f23 — ImplementFilterRule sets innerAlias on RecordQueryPredicatesFilterPlan. All correlated paths (scalar subquery, EXISTS, JOIN) work without indexes. 14+ integration tests verify.
- [x] **RIGHT/FULL OUTER JOIN.** Done in RFC-036. (The old "only LEFT OUTER" note was stale — RIGHT already worked via operand-swap normalization in `cascades_translator.go`, pinned by `TestFDB_RightJoin`.) FULL OUTER added as a Go-only query extension: Java's SQL layer has **no** outer joins at all (`visitOuterJoin` is a no-op, zero tests), so LEFT/RIGHT/FULL are all read-path-only extensions with **zero wire-format impact** — Java apps still read/write the same records. FULL OUTER is implemented exclusively by the materialized NLJ cursor (`streaming_cursors.go`): LEFT-OUTER outer loop + a `matchedInner` bitmap + a drain phase emitting unmatched inner rows NULL-padded on the left. Routed away from the correlated FlatMap path (cannot observe global inner-match state); FULL+EXISTS rejected with a clear error. 9 FDB integration tests (all four row classes, NULL-key 3VL, many-to-many, large-inner hash+drain, WHERE-above-join, determinism, RIGHT NULL-key regression). Graefe+Torvalds ACK.
- [x] **Correlated scalar subquery shapes widened.** Non-aggregate (ORDER BY + LIMIT), multi-table inner FROM (JOINs), multi-column validation, deep-walk replaceScalarSubqueryRef. GROUP BY/HAVING rejected with clear errors (PredicatePushDownRule AliasMap conflict). CorrelatedExistsError propagation fixed.
- [ ] **No window functions.** No `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `LAG/LEAD`.
- [ ] **GROUP BY/HAVING in correlated scalar subqueries.** Requires PredicatePushDownRule to treat GroupByExpression as a barrier (AliasMap.Compose conflict on correlation alias). Per Graefe: runtime cardinality assertions incompatible with continuation-based pagination — use Java's FirstOrDefault pattern.
- [ ] **PlanVisitor resolver lacks SubqueryPlanner.** Scalar subquery error messages don't propagate through step (2) projection resolution because the resolver has no SubqueryPlanner. workaround: errors propagate through upgradeProjectionValues (step 12) instead.
- [x] **DML does not execute through Cascades (parallel pipeline).** Fixed as **P0.4** — all DML now executes through Cascades (`planDML`); the naive `execStatement` DML path is deleted. See P0.4.

### Beyond Java (Go-only improvements)

- [x] **Full Graefe Memo with cross-group merging.** Done in RFC-037 — union-find group merging (the Cascades-paper "merge two groups discovered to be one", §2 + §3.5), a Go-only extension beyond Java (which, like the pre-RFC Go memo, only interns at insertion time). `Reference` gains a monotonic `id` + `forwardedTo` + path-compressed `Canonical()`; every state-bearing method resolves the receiver to canonical, so a merged-away (loser) Reference transparently forwards — no in-flight task, Quantifier, or binding is rewritten. `GetRangesOver()` resolves at the single chokepoint (444 sites). `Memo.Integrate` hooks the REWRITING yield path: when a yielded expression equals a member of a different group, the two merge (survivor = lower id, deterministic), folding members + exploration state, repointing the topology index, invalidating correlation caches up the DAG, and recursively re-merging parents (paper's bottom-up recursion). Scoped to REWRITING (PLANNING winners/partial-matches embed raw References — guarded by `mergeable`); ancestor/descendant (idempotence) merges skipped to avoid DAG cycles. Wire compat untouched (read-path-only sharing). Merge fires through the real planner (`TestMemoMerge_FiresThroughRealPlanner`); 9 merge unit tests + determinism 50×/10×; 46/46 targets green; stress-1M unchanged. Graefe+Torvalds ACK (NAK'd v1 on in-flight-task stranding + cache staleness + index repoint + upward re-merge — all fixed in v2). **Reach caveat (honest):** the merge is correct and fires, but its practical reach is narrow today — the memo's interning/equivalence is alias-sensitive, and rule-rewritten equivalents mint fresh quantifier aliases, so equivalent sub-expressions intern to *different* child References and rarely surface as merge candidates (measured: exactly one merge on a K-branch equivalent UNION regardless of K; ~2% planner-time delta; no execution-time effect — same plan). Broad merging (and any real speedup / multi-way-join-order benefit) is **gated on alias-namespace unification (item 7.1 below)**; this PR lands the correct merge *infrastructure*, not a present-day perf win. Remaining (Future Work): **alias-normalized equivalence (7.1) — the lever**; reduction-rule-triggered merges (§3.6); PLANNING-phase merging; cost-model exploitation of shared sub-products for full N-way join-order optimality.
- [x] **Correlated scalar subqueries.** Go-only extension — Java rejects at grammar level. Implemented via FlatMap with JoinTypeLeftOuter.

## Production readiness (Graefe review, 2026-05-28)

The Cascades architecture is solid — task stack, two-phase REWRITING+PLANNING, 16-criteria cost model, match-candidate infra all well-ported. The production risks are all at the **boundaries**: planner↔executor, executor↔runtime, system↔operator. Priority tiers below.

### P0 — fix before deploying anywhere (correctness/availability)

- [x] **🚩 P0.4 DML executes through Cascades.** Fixed in RFC-035 — all DML (INSERT VALUES/SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE) routes through `planDML` → Cascades executor; `planOne` no longer branches on exec mode and the naive `execStatement` DML path (`execInsert`/`execUpdate`/`execDelete`/`execInsertSelect`, `pkPushdownCursor`) is deleted. INSERT VALUES reuses the Explode operator (RecordConstructor→Array→Explode→Insert) with plan-time arity/NOT-NULL/coercion; UPDATE SET RHS resolves to Values; DELETE/UPDATE WHERE gets EXISTS/scalar-subquery support via `upgradeDMLWhereWithCatalog`; INSERT…SELECT maps projection→target positionally and materializes (Halloween-safe). `IsUpdate()` derived from physical plan type; `RowsAffected` counted (Java's countUpdates); DML respects explicit transactions via `runInTx`. Fixed a latent non-correlated-EXISTS semi-join bug that also affected SELECT. QueryContext rejects update plans before executing (use Exec) — documented divergence in DIVERGENCES.md. Corner-case tests in `dml_cascades_fdb_test.go`. Graefe+Torvalds ACK (direction + implementation).
- [x] **P0.1 NLJ memory bomb.** Fixed in PR #203 — `CollectAllBounded` with configurable materialization limit (default 100K rows) on all 6 `CollectAll` sites. `MaterializationLimitExceededError` typed error. All cursor leaks on error path fixed. 11 regression tests. RFC-028.
- [x] **P0.2 Plan cache serves wrong plans.** Fixed in RFC-029 — cache keys on normalized SQL string directly (was uint64 FNV-64a hash with no text comparison on hit → collision = wrong plan). Scalar subquery staleness was a non-issue: `scalarSubqueryBinding` stores plans not results, re-evaluated per page fetch. `QueryHash` retained for tests only.
- [x] **P0.3 No context cancellation in executor.** Fixed in RFC-030 — `ctx.Err()` checks at the top of every cursor OnNext loop and drain function (44 sites across 19 files). `autoContinuingCursor` was the worst offender (created new FDB transactions on cancelled contexts). All cursor combinators, executor cursors, utility drains, DML drains, legacy query path drains, and iterator adapters now respect Go context cancellation. 24 unit tests verify prompt cancellation.

### P1 — fix before relying on the optimizer for real workloads (plan quality)

- [x] **P1.1 Wire statistics from FDB.** Fixed in RFC-031 — `fetchTableStatistics` was already wired (nightshift-100) but had two bugs: used read-write transactions for read-only stats (wasted commit), and fabricated equal-distribution counts for intermingled schemas. Fixed: `FDBDatabase.RunRead()` for no-commit snapshot reads, dropped intermingled fallback (returns nil → safe DefaultStatistics). E2E FDB integration test proves full pipeline: count maintenance → stats read → cost model → plan selection → execution.
- [x] **P1.2 Complete QOV-based FieldValue migration.** Fixed in RFC-032 — all 10 `stripAlias*` calls deleted (8 NLJ rule, 2 PushFilterBelowJoinRule). Predicates now retain `FieldValue(QOV(correlationId), "column")`; filters use `PredicatesFilterPlanWithAlias` so the executor binds each row under its correlation alias and resolves via `evaluateCorrelated` — zero string manipulation. `executePredicatesFilter` binds the inner alias whenever present (was gated on params only). Root cause exposed: `PartitionBinarySelectRule` (Java inner-join rule) fired on LEFT OUTER joins, pushing nullable-side predicates pre-join; guarded with `JoinInner`. `mergeRows` string qualification untouched (operates on executor row maps, not planner Values — separate concern). All 46 targets pass; determinism verified.

### P2 — fix before scaling operations

- [x] **P2.1 Plan cache LRU is O(n) per hit.** Fixed in RFC-033 — replaced the slice-based LRU order tracking (linear scan + slice splice in `promote()` on every hit, under the lock) with a `container/list` doubly-linked list + `map[string]*list.Element`. Promote-on-hit/update and eviction are now O(1), matching Java's Caffeine-backed cache. `RWMutex` downgraded to `Mutex` (the read path always mutated the list, so the read lock was a lie). `BenchmarkPlanCache_HitLargeCache` confirms position-independent O(1) hits at maxSize=1024; all existing LRU-semantics tests pass unchanged + new interleaved-eviction test.
- [x] **P2.2 Operational debuggability.** Fixed in RFC-034 — `PlanGenerationLogger` hook (nil = silent) emits one `PlanGenerationInfo` per Cascades planning call: SQL (truncated, rune-safe), plan hash (`plans.PlanHash`), plan explain, planning duration, cache event (hit/miss/skip/inconclusive), cache size, slow-query flag, error. Go analog of Java's `RelationalLoggingUtil` + `PlanGenerator` finally block; wired into `planSelectCascades` (real query) and `planDML` via a shared `planLogScope` with a named-return defer. EXPLAIN re-entry suppressed via `logMetrics bool`. No scalar "estimated cost" — the Cascades cost model is a comparator, not a number (matches Java; logs plan hash + explain instead). Threshold default sourced from the canonical `api.OptLogSlowQueryThresholdMicros` (single source of truth); `OptLogQuery` left intentionally unwired (no SLF4J level concept in Go — handler owns level + sampling), documented at `options.go:55`. Sampling is the handler's responsibility. 11 unit tests + 2 FDB integration tests (DML Skip event, SELECT miss-then-hit through the public driver). Graefe ACK, Torvalds ACK.

## Phase 8: Planner architecture cleanup (Graefe review findings)

### 8.1 Evaluate `pushDataAccessTasks` as CascadesRule — RESOLVED (keep procedural)

Graefe flagged this as procedural code that should be a rule. After investigation: **the procedural approach is architecturally correct.** `pushDataAccessTasks` operates on Reference-level PartialMatch state, not expression types — CascadesRules require expression-type pattern matching. Java uses explicit `TransformMatchPartition` task types for the same reason: this is task-level logic, not rule-level. Go's direct method call in `ExploreExprTask.Run()` is simpler and equivalent. No change needed.

### 8.2 Verify `promoteByDataAccessCost` heuristic absorbed — VERIFIED

`promoteByDataAccessCost` was deleted in eb94291a (dead code cleanup). Its heuristic (prefer lower-cardinality data access) IS absorbed into `PlanningCostModelLess` at `planning_cost_model.go:191–208` — Criterion #2: `maxDataAccessCardinality`, lower wins. This fires via `stampOrderingWinners(ref, costModel)` after every data access insertion. The cost model uses the same `findExpressionsByType` + `maxDataAccessCardinality` comparison. No heuristic was dropped.

### 8.3 Document `maxRoundsPerRef = 10` cap — DONE

Added comment at `unified_tasks.go:59` explaining: prevents divergence from rule cycles (A→B→A) that produce distinct-but-equivalent members. Java relies on memo dedup for fixpoint; Go's per-Reference dedup is weaker, so pathological rule interactions can produce new members indefinitely. 10 rounds >> typical 2–3 needed, safely under MaxTasks budget.

---

## Phase 7: Cascades alignment — close remaining Java divergences

### 7.1 Unify alias namespaces — DONE

Quantifier aliases now match table aliases at creation. Three band-aids removed: `rightAliasSet`, `planContainsJoin`, `collectPlanAliases` (−114 lines). Root-cause fix in `mergeRows`: bare inner keys overwrote qualified keys from nested joins (missing `!exists` guard). 46/46 tests, 15/15 determinism.

### 7.2 Port matching infrastructure for index intersections — DONE

`IndexIntersectionRule` deleted (Go-only REWRITING-phase rule). Replaced with match-based PLANNING-phase intersection via `WithPrimaryKeyIntersector` in `intersector_primary_key.go`. Wired into `pushDataAccessTasks` with guards: candidate cap (4), match cap (8), restricted-scan filter, idempotency via `hasIntersectionFinal`. Two regressions found and fixed: IS NULL correctness (zero-coverage matches created incorrect intersections, fixed by filtering to restricted scans only) and MaxTasks (intersection logic ran N times per Reference, fixed by idempotency guard). 46/46 tests, 10/10 determinism.

### 7.3 Convert remaining predicateReferencesAlias sites — DONE

All 8 `predicateReferencesAlias` calls in the NLJ rule converted to `GetCorrelatedToOfPredicate` correlation-set checks. Function deleted. Root-cause fix: `qualifyBareFieldValue` in EXISTS builder now produces QOV-based FieldValues instead of flat strings. `walkPredicateFieldValues`/`fieldValueAliasAndCol` survive in push-filter/push-projection rules (handle both QOV and flat FieldValues for unit test compatibility).

### 7.4 FlatMap wrapper correlation propagation — NOT NEEDED (Graefe confirmed)

Graefe confirmed: `GetCorrelatedToWithoutChildren()` returning empty is correct for BOTH joins AND correlated subqueries. Correlations flow through quantifier children in both cases. `JoinMergeResultValue.Children()` does NOT need QOV nodes.

For correlated scalar subqueries (Go-only extension, Java rejects at grammar level), the correct Cascades architecture is:
1. `ForEachNullOnEmpty` quantifier (already exists: `ForEachNullOnEmptyQuantifier`)
2. `RecordQueryFirstOrDefaultPlan` with NULL default (already exists)
3. Correlated `BuildScalar` fallback (needs: full inner plan with outer scope, correlation predicate extraction)
4. NLJ rule: detect NullOnEmpty → wrap inner with FirstOrDefault + FlatMap

NLJ wrapper correlation propagation (walks predicates) is already correct and active.
